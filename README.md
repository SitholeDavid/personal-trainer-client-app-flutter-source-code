# Personal Trainer Client App

This is a flutter app that complements the personal trainer app. It's used by a trainer's clients to book sessions, keep track of upcoming sessions and also the number of sessions left on their current plan. The clients can also purchase new plans in the app.

This app is linked to the personal trainer app by connecting to the same backend.

The app utilizes Firebase FCM messaging, Firebase cloud storage, Firebase firestore and also Firebase Auth.

For state management the stacked and stacked_services packages were used.

For the payment gateway Paystack was used. 

Get_It was used for dependency injection.

Abstraction was used for the service classes to make mock unit testing easier.
